# Background 

Friends of the Children-Los Angeles is a nonprofit organization that pairs underserved youth with a paid, professional mentor called a Friend.
They support their youth through a long-term relationship from as early as age 4 through high school graduation - 12+ years, no matter what.

# The Problem & Challenge

***How might you design a user-friendly and streamlined communication system for Friends of the Children to improve collaboration and information sharing between mentors, administrators, and caregivers, while ensuring ease of navigation and access to relevant resources?***

# The Solution

We propose creating **a web application that serves as an all encompassing, centralized resource bank for caregivers which includes modules with links and resources, calendar with upcoming events, and text/email system for reminders and announcements**. Friends of the Children administration will have an interface to add and delete modules, add and delete calendar events, and send mass email announcements. This website will further Friends of the Children-Los Angeles‚Äôs goal in aiding underserved youth such as those in foster care, supporting caregivers in their two-generation approach, and raising awareness for the mental health of youth! As such, we keep the following considerations in mind for the extent of this project:

- **Accessibility and ease-of-use.** The website must be easily navigable and accessible for mentors and caregivers on the external side. On the internal side, the app should allow for efficient management of mentor/mentee pages and easy admin management of modules (even big size files).
- **Prioritizing usability and upkeep by FOTC after handoff.** FOTC has one person as an IT Manager, so designing a flexible and thoroughly debugged system is critical to ensuring the apps enduring usefulness.

To achieve this, we propose a web application with these primary features:

1. A **module display** that enables admin to add or edit modules, mentors and caregivers to view and access resources in each module. 
2. A **calendar system** for admin to add and view events, and mentors and caregivers to view events.
3. **Message Wall / Email + Text system** allows Admin to make announcements, post them on a message wall, and make sure mentors and caregivers are notified via email or text.

# Research

## Competitive Analysis

Since the main feature of our app is the module system, we conducted an analysis of five competitors which offer services similar to that of FOTC‚Äôs desired module system: Blackboard, Google Classroom, Canvas, Notion, and Google Drive. We were then able to identify commonalities between them which suggested features we should incorporate in our own product, as well as things that stood out and that we‚Äôd like to avoid doing.

![Competitive Analysis - Key Takeaways](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/lablueprint/website/case-studies/src/app/assets/images/projects/FOTC/fotc-comp-analysis-key-takeaways.png)

## User Interviews

We conducted interviews with five FOTC members including admin (Program Director, Family Engagement Assistant), mentors, and caregivers.

- *Asked about what kind of inconveniences occur when teaching and what organization system would be preferred*
- *Showed a few lo-fi screens for feedback / evaluate tech familiarity / understand what resources are needed to operate*

## Insights

Lastly, we synthesized our findings from both the competitive audit and the preliminary user interviews to identify valuable insights.

- Event details get spread through word of mouth / posted on the website
    - People often forget about event dates and details as they rely on emails
- No way to prioritize upcoming imminent messages / announcements
    - Hard to access upcoming FOTC events
- No mass uploading of resources from admin
    - Constantly producing flyers and sending them individually is a hassle
- Disorganization in files makes resources hard to find
- Mass communication is complicated through email
    - No easy direct link of communication between admin and mentors

## Usability Testing

To gather feedback and gain insights on the initial app design, we performed usability tests involving five users affiliated with Friends of the Children. In general, the participants found the new app user-friendly. Although there were instances of confusion regarding specific features, the users expressed that the app was relatively simple to understand and navigate.

Users also pointed out significant issues that needed to be implemented:

- Notification System
- Mentors should also be able to post resources on the main page
- Safety & privacy issue -> Media release check
- Not intuitive features
- Name change from ‚ÄúMentors and Mentees‚Äù -> ‚ÄúFriends and Youth‚Äù

We iterated our hifi designs and made design decisions based on the feedback.

# Next Steps

As of July 2023, we are actively preparing for the launch of our web app, scheduled for Summer 2023. Our development team is currently focused on refining the visual presentation, deploying, and finalizing the handoff to FOTC. Given additional time, our designers would have conducted extra interviews and usability tests to gather further feedback from actual users. Additionally, we would have dedicated time to enhance the overall cohesiveness of the website's interface across all screens.
