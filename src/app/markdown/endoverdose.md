# **Background**

End Overdose is a national nonprofit organization dedicated to preventing drug-related deaths through education, training, and the distribution of life-saving resources. The organization focuses on harm reduction strategies, community empowerment, and accessible tools like naloxone to combat the opioid crisis and support individuals at risk.

# **The Challenge**

End Overdose needed support in transforming their existing online learning modules into a version tailored for high school students. The goal was to create a platform that was district-approved, age-appropriate, and engaging—making it easier for schools to integrate life-saving overdose prevention education into their curriculum.

# **Solution**

To achieve this, we proposed an educational web application with the following key features:

1. **Structured courses and modules** that guide students through clear, easy-to-follow lessons.

2. **Gamified quizzes** that make learning interactive and enjoyable while reinforcing key concepts.

3. **User customization**, allowing students to personalize avatars and create a more engaging, personal experience.

# **Process**

# **Research**

## **Competitive Analysis**

We conducted a competitive analysis of both educational and gaming platforms to better understand how to design a school-friendly and engaging learning experience. Our research included platforms like Duolingo, Skillshare, Khan Academy, Codecademy, edX, and Coursera, as well as games like Pokémon and Animal Crossing. We focused on elements such as course structure, quiz design, reward systems, and interactive features like missions and challenges.

Key findings from our research included:

* All educational platforms used **sequential content**, requiring users to complete earlier modules before progressing.

* All gaming platforms featured **customization options**—such as character, home, or team personalization—to create a more immersive experience.

* Every platform incorporated **microrewards** like points, badges, or tokens to keep users motivated and engaged.

## **User Interviews**

To better understand user engagement and pain points, we interviewed potential users from diverse backgrounds, age groups, and locations. Our goal was to gather insights from a wide range of perspectives, including students, educators, and trainers at End Overdose.

![user_interviews.png](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/lablueprint/website/master/src/app/assets/images/projects/EO/user_interviews.png)

## **Affinity Mapping**

Post-interviews, we created an affinity map to categorize the challenges, processes, and motivations shared by users.

## **Key Takeaways / Iterated Final Solutions**

![key_takeaways.png](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/lablueprint/website/master/src/app/assets/images/projects/EO/key_takeaways.png)

## **User Flow**

To map out the ideal user experience, we created a user flow that outlines the journey from onboarding, course completion, and even admin views. This helped us identify key actions, reduce friction, and ensure the platform feels intuitive for all three sets of users.

![user_flow.png](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/lablueprint/website/master/src/app/assets/images/projects/EO/user_flow.png)

# **Ideation**

With a clear understanding of the problem space, we began outlining opportunities to address key challenges while staying true to End Overdose’s mission. We explored ways to make overdose prevention education both accessible and engaging for high school students. By identifying areas for innovation—such as gamification, personalization, and curriculum alignment—we ensured our proposed solution would provide real value and stand out in the educational space.

## **Iterative Designs**

Before jumping into high-fidelity designs, we dedicated hours to brainstorming, sketching, and exploring different directions—intentionally building a strong foundation of ideas. Everyone contributed freely, knowing no idea was off-limits until we had a chance to see it framed out.

This collaborative, judgment-free environment helped us spark creativity and uncover surprising solutions. Once we had a pool of concepts, we came together to discuss what resonated, what didn’t, and why—shaping our direction through honest feedback and open dialogue.

Here are a few of our lo-fi screens:

And here are some of our mid-fi screens:

## **Usability Testing**

To further refine our designs, we conducted usability testing with three team members from End Overdose. We shared a clickable prototype and gathered feedback on usability, visual clarity, and overall engagement. While participants generally responded positively to the platform's look and feel, their insights revealed key areas for improvement—particularly in visual hierarchy, navigation, and interactive elements. A few specific examples of these refinements are shown below.

**Home**

Users struggled with the formatting and wording on the home page, so we reorganized the layout to improve clarity and flow and updated language to be more user-centric and intuitive

![home.png](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/lablueprint/website/master/src/app/assets/images/projects/EO/home.png)

**Nav Bar**

Based on feedback and feasibility, we simplified the navigation by removing unnecessary elements like the search bar and rounding edges and refining spacing for a softer, more inviting look

# **Final Designs**

**Onboarding**

Users can sign in or create a new account where they can then learn more about End Overdose and customize their username

![onboarding.gif](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/lablueprint/website/master/src/app/assets/images/projects/EO/onboarding.gif)

**Home**

Where users can find their current and upcoming lessons assigned to them by their school

![home.gif](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/lablueprint/website/master/src/app/assets/images/projects/EO/home.gif)

**Course Content**

Students are presented with a school-approved overdose prevention course developed in collaboration with the End Overdose team. The course delivers key information through a mix of visuals and text, making the material both engaging and easy to understand.

![course_content.gif](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/lablueprint/website/master/src/app/assets/images/projects/EO/course_content.gif)


**Multiple Choice Game**

Between lessons, students engage with an interactive multiple-choice game designed to reinforce key concepts. Each question presents four possible answers, and students must select the correct one to test their understanding and strengthen retention.

![MCQ.gif](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/lablueprint/website/master/src/app/assets/images/projects/EO/MCQ.gif)


**True or False Game**

Students participate in a true-or-false game that appears throughout the course to reinforce learning. They are presented with statements related to overdose prevention and must decide whether each one is correct, helping them quickly assess and strengthen their understanding.

![true_or_false.gif](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/lablueprint/website/master/src/app/assets/images/projects/EO/true_or_false.gif)


**Scenario Game**

Students engage with scenario-based games that present real-life situations related to overdose prevention. They must choose the best course of action, allowing them to apply what they’ve learned and practice decision-making in a safe, interactive environment.

![scenario_game.gif](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/lablueprint/website/master/src/app/assets/images/projects/EO/scenario_game.gif)


**Certificate**

At the end of each course, students receive a certificate of completion that they can download and keep, providing a sense of accomplishment and a tangible record of their learning.

![certificate.gif](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/lablueprint/website/master/src/app/assets/images/projects/EO/certificate.gif)


**Profile**

Users can personalize their experience by customizing their Narcat avatar and banner, making the platform more engaging and reflective of their own style.

# **Next Steps**

We are currently planning the next phase of development and are excited about introducing more courses via End Overdose\! Given more time, we would love to add even more variety in the games and interactive experiences, making the platform even more dynamic and rewarding for students.
