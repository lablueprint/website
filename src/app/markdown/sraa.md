# Background

The Skid Row Arts Alliance is a consortium of artist-driven organizations in Skid Row, dedicated to **creating art**, **fostering community**, and **advocating for residents**. **~4,000 Skid Row residents** face the threat of gentrification due to their community not being recognized as an entity. SRAA brings individuals together and **represents their voices through arts and culture** to support place-keeping for all Skid Row residents.

# Problem

Currently, the Skid Row Arts Alliance relies on multiple platforms to promote its events and host various resources. This leads to an unorganized distribution of information and a potential lack of visibility for the community members we aim to engage.

# The Challenge

***How can we centralize SRAA's resources and events onto a unified platform, enhancing accessibility, while fostering a sense of connection within the underrepresented Skid Row community through the mediums of art and culture?***

# Solution

Our solution is a mobile app that allows residents of Skid Row to discover events, resources, and communities where they can find an outlet to feel empowered. 

Features:

1. An **accessible map** with calendar events and resources available in Skid Row
2. A pdf reader of past released **Zine** articles
3. A **Digital Art Platform** where users can share their works and **profiles** with other members of the community
4. An **Admin Portal** where SRAA admins can easily update the map by adding and deleting events, resources, zines, and curating the gallery
