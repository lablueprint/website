# Background

United Way of Greater Los Angeles is a nonprofit focused on ending poverty by advancing housing stability, educational equity, and economic mobility across L.A. County. In 2023 alone, they engaged over 500 Pico-Union community members, created 592 units of affordable housing, and invested $5.9 million in shelter improvement initiatives. Since 1922, they have supported hundreds of thousands of individuals and families through direct services, partnerships, and policy advocacy.

# The Challenge

People across Los Angeles have lacked a centralized, accessible way to find local volunteer opportunities, making it difficult to give back to the community consistently. This has not only limited community engagement but also made it harder for United Way of Greater Los Angeles to mobilize and retain reliable volunteers for their initiatives.

# The Goal

To create a platform that makes it easy for individuals to discover, track, and stay engaged with local volunteer opportunities. By simplifying the process and making it more accessible, the aim was to strengthen community involvement and help United Way of Greater Los Angeles better connect with and mobilize volunteers.

# Solution

In collaboration with United Way of Greater Los Angeles, we identified a core challenge: while the organization has a strong network of nonprofits and community partners, volunteer turnout at events remains inconsistent. Many community members simply aren’t aware of opportunities to engage. To address this gap, we conceptualized a digital solution designed to increase visibility, streamline participation, and strengthen the connection between nonprofits and volunteers.

Our vision involves creating two complementary platforms that work together to support both nonprofits and community members. For nonprofits, we will design an administrative website that allows organizations to easily host and manage events, track sign-ups, organize raffles, and measure engagement through built-in analytics. This tool will give nonprofits greater control and insight into their outreach efforts.

For volunteers, we will design a mobile application that makes discovering and registering for events effortless. With features like event notifications, reminders, and clear event details, the app ensures community members are not only informed but also motivated to participate. By addressing the issue of visibility and accessibility, the app aims to transform how people connect with volunteer opportunities across Los Angeles.

# Research

## Competitive analysis

![Frame 2095597357.png](Case%20Study%202030b0d5dcb5800b9036c421723d87da/Frame_2095597357%201.png)

With our mission to create an intuitive and empathetic mobile based platform to empower small business hosting community events, we conducted an analysis of 6 different competitors that offered event-hosting platforms and rewards-based services similar to our goal: EventPin, Luma, Ulta Beauty, Eventbrite, Nextdoor, and Fetch. This audit helped us gain a holistic understanding of not only the current market but the commonalities of features that were most user friendly. This analysis guided us in optimizing editing workflows and steering clear of patterns that could hinder usability.

## Affinity Mapping

Following our interviews and competitive analysis, we looked to synthesize our conclusions and insights through an Affinity Map, that helped us identify commonalities, strengths, and shared pain points. 

![image.png](Case%20Study%202030b0d5dcb5800b9036c421723d87da/image%201.png)

![image.png](Case%20Study%202030b0d5dcb5800b9036c421723d87da/image%202.png)

## User interviews

With a solid grasp of our goals and timeline, it was vital for us to not only understand what features would suit our users best but also the pain points of the community we are serving. We looked to conduct user interviews to fully grasp a holistic view of the challenges, pain points, and motivations behind our community. Designing an app serving many different users, from business owners to community attendees, we were intentional about inviting every and all possible backgrounds, working with United Way Staff and its community partners.   

## Research Key Takeaways

- Current methods of outreach subside of on-the-ground outreach methods such as flyers or basic social media distribution channels through Facebook community posts.
- Community organizers value minimizing friction during check-in processes as well as seamless integration of local partnerships with vendors and other connections
- Improving attendance rate, i.e. percentage of people following through initial sign up, is an important priority.
- Event attendees value ease of access to important event information, personalization, and efficient organizational filters of events without overbearing reminders

## Ideation

By engaging with and understanding all the users involved in our mission, we identified key pain points and uncovered opportunities to address them. From these insights, we framed the following **How Might We** questions to guide our design process:

- How might we motivate attendees to actively participate in their communities through a rewards-based ecosystem?
- How might we design a community-centered in-app activities that amplify and support event organizers’ cultural, community-serving, and empowerment missions?

![image.png](Case%20Study%202030b0d5dcb5800b9036c421723d87da/image%203.png)

## **User Flow**

Before kickstarting our designs, we established an information architecture from our various insights. This helped guide the structure of our app and how its proposed features would address previously identified pain points, align with our mission, and best support intuitive, engaging work flows.

![image.png](Case%20Study%202030b0d5dcb5800b9036c421723d87da/image%204.png)

# Iterative designs

As we moved from initial concepts to more refined prototypes, our team relied on an iterative design process grounded in user research and feedback. Each round of testing informed the next, ensuring that every feature—from event sign-up flows to the nonprofit admin dashboard—aligned with the real needs of our stakeholders.

A key strength of our approach was fostering a collaborative environment where all ideas were welcomed before being tested on a frame. This mindset encouraged experimentation and creativity, allowing us to generate innovative solutions through quick sketches, team huddles, and rapid prototyping sessions. By treating design as a continuous cycle of exploration and refinement, we were able to evolve our ideas into practical, user-friendly tools.

Here are a few examples of our low- and mid-fidelity wireframes:

## Usability Testing

#1 From Calendar to Apple Wallet

- It was difficult seeing more than one event in a seamless way which allowed the user to quickly access an event.
- Got idea from an Apple Wallet design in order to be able to seamlessly look at each of the events

![My Events (2).png](Case%20Study%202030b0d5dcb5800b9036c421723d87da/My_Events_(2).png)

![no events.png](Case%20Study%202030b0d5dcb5800b9036c421723d87da/no_events.png)

#2 From Dropdown to Seamless Scroll

- In the rewards sections, users may have had a difficult time in scrolling through rewards in a non-functional way in which all the nonprofits had looked the same
- Instead of having a drop down bar for the organizations, a scroll list was implemented with the organizations profile pics

![Rewards + Dropdown.png](Case%20Study%202030b0d5dcb5800b9036c421723d87da/Rewards__Dropdown.png)

![Rewards.png](Case%20Study%202030b0d5dcb5800b9036c421723d87da/Rewards.png)

# Thoughtful Considerations

1. **Bringing Focus to Upcoming Commitments**
    
    Since many volunteers register for multiple events at once, it’s important to give them a clear way to keep track of what’s ahead. To support this, we chose a card-based vertical list layout that makes the event name and date immediately visible, helping volunteers quickly recognize and organize their upcoming commitments.
    

![My Events.svg](Case%20Study%202030b0d5dcb5800b9036c421723d87da/My_Events.svg)

1. **Driving Event Participation**
    
    When users first sign up, we encourage them to discover and join events by showcasing personalized recommendations directly within the My Events page. This intentional placement helps guide new users toward meaningful engagement right from the start.

1. A streamlined event signup and management flow removes friction, making it easier and more motivating for users to participate in events.
2. Seamless integration of live event-to-user activities, enabling easy engagement and communication between organizers and users currently inside the events.
3. Building community through rewards-based incentive programs, one event at a time; your local community engagement tool!

# Next steps

Currently, the project is in process of user-testing with United Way, ensuring that their local organizations have an intuitive feeling in using the tooling provided. With finalized designs and fleshing out code, we are looking to perform a beta website deployment soon for initial test runs with local organizations. We will be rolling out usage to several test communities and organizations with. Our mobile app being in the works to be deployed on both Google Play and App Store.
