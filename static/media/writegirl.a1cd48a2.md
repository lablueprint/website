# Background

WriteGirl, based in Los Angeles, empowers underserved girls and gender-expansive youth by promoting creativity and self-expression through mentorship from a community of women writers. With over 200 volunteer women writers, WriteGirl serves more than 500 girls each year. They conduct numerous workshops, panel discussions, and special events annually, helping participants develop their creativity, succeed in high school, and prepare for college.

# The Challenge

**_How can we bring the magic of WriteGirl’s creative writing programs to a global audience?_**

The transition to digital spaces has proven challenging, as writing workshops and mentoring sessions lose some of their impact and robustness online. WriteGirl engages with young people from distant locations like Uganda and Tajikistan, who are unable to attend in-person events and resources, highlighting the need for a more effective digital solution.

# Solution

In collaboration with our product partners at WriteGirl, we identified key pain points and potential projects, leading us to conceptualize a creative writing app. This app aims to replicate the enriching experience of WriteGirl’s in-person workshops in a digital format, making their resources more accessible worldwide.

Our vision for the app includes features designed to appeal to a wide audience, including girls, gender-expansive youth, and even adults of all genders. The distinctive features we planned are intended to serve as tools or companions for writers, much like WriteGirl’s workshops do.

Key Features:

- **Progressive Writing Activities:** Unique categories that tap into a writer's memories, emotions, and perspectives.
- **Mind & Body Moments:** A classic in-person workshop activity that integrate mindfulness to inspire creativity.
- **Tailored Writing Tips:** Personalized advice and guidance for improving writing skills.
- **Tactile and Sensory Elements:** Engaging all the user’s senses to enhance the writing experience.

# Process

# Research

## Competitive Analysis

We conducted an audit of the strengths and weaknesses of 6 existing apps in the creative writing market. The main takeaway was that these apps often provided surface-level content. We aimed to differentiate our app not only through its immersive design but also through the depth and quality of its activities.

Our prompts would be progressive and designed to engage users' senses, memories, and deeper emotions, creating a more meaningful and impactful writing experience.

![Competitive Analysis](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/lablueprint/website/master/src/app/assets/images/projects/WriteGirl/wg_comp_analysis.png)

## User Interviews

With a clear understanding of what we wanted to achieve and how we planned to do it, it was time to understand who our users were. We conducted user interviews to gather insights into the challenges, processes, and motivations behind their creative writing experiences.

![User Interviews](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/lablueprint/website/master/src/app/assets/images/projects/WriteGirl/wg_user_interviews.png)

## Insight Synthesis

Post-interviews, we created an affinity map to categorize the challenges, processes, and motivations shared by users.

![Insight Synthesis](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/lablueprint/website/master/src/app/assets/images/projects/WriteGirl/wg_insight_synth_1.png)

From these insights, we identified 4 main pain points:

![Insight Synthesis - Main Pain Points](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/lablueprint/website/master/src/app/assets/images/projects/WriteGirl/wg_insight_synth_2.png)

# Ideation

With a thorough understanding of the problem space, we outlined opportunities to address these pain points while embodying WriteGirl's vision. We identified areas for innovation and value creation, ensuring our app would stand out.

![Ideation](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/lablueprint/website/master/src/app/assets/images/projects/WriteGirl/wg_ideation.png)

## User Flow

We used insights from our competitive analysis, interviews, and affinity mapping to create user journeys within our app. This process helped us design intuitive and engaging user flows that addressed the identified pain points and aligned with WriteGirl's mission.

![User Flow](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/lablueprint/website/master/src/app/assets/images/projects/WriteGirl/wg_userflow.png)

# Iterative Designs

As we transitioned to higher fidelity designs, we ensured our designers adhered to our research, guiding a highly iterative process for each feature and screen.

A space aspect of our design team was our ability to foster an environment where there were no “bad” ideas until they are put on a frame . This approach encouraged creativity, resulting in innovative ideas from spontaneous team huddles and a playful design process.

Here are a few of our lo-fi screens:

And a couple of our many mid-fi screens:

## Usability Testing

After conducting usability testing with seven users, we identified opportunities to enhance the user experience and design. We focused on understanding where users struggled, why they encountered these difficulties, and how we could improve the app.

<ins>#1 Discoverability and Consistency</ins>

**Issue:** Users had difficulty discovering and consistently using app features, particularly the history feature.

**Solution:** We made the history feature more accessible on end state pages, eliminating the need for backtracking and improving discoverability.

![Usability Testing  - Discoverability and Consistency](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/lablueprint/website/master/src/app/assets/images/projects/WriteGirl/wg_usability_testing_1.png)

<ins>#2 User-Centric Wording</ins>

**Issue:** Users suggested clearer guiding text and action phrases for a more intuitive and personable app experience.

**Solution:** We incorporated user-centric wording, making buttons more intuitive and the app more relatable. For example, we changed "type of break" to "part of you," "mental" to "my mind," and "physical" to "all of me."

# Thoughtful Considerations

WriteGirl excels in evoking unique creative processes and encouraging writers to draw from personal experiences. Our goal was to bring this essence into the mobile app.

### #1 Placing Graphics Intentionally

All our graphics are continuous hand-drawn illustrations that are strategically placed. For example, in Triple Flips, we decided to remove graphics and keep only the text. This choice empowers users to imagine what the text might look like through their own creativity, as opposed being guided towards a predefined visualization

![Placing Graphics Intentionally](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/lablueprint/website/master/src/app/assets/images/projects/WriteGirl/wg_considerations_1.png)

### #2 Humanizing the App

Another consideration was humanizing the app through small additions of copy write. In addition to more user-centric wording, when users scroll to the bottom of the screen, they will see friendly and encouraging messages. This humanization also brings in the in-person workshop touch.
